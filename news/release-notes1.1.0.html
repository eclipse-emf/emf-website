<li><b><a name="emf110_1">Eclipse 2.1 based</a></b> 

<p>As with EMF 1.0.2, the EMF 1.1.0 drivers will only work well
with Eclipse 2.1 or Eclipse 2.1.1. They should work with 2.0.2, but
they won't get the CLASSPATH correct for .editor projects.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</li>

<li><b><a name="emf110_2">Migration from 1.0.2</a></b> 

<p>Code regeneration of 1.0.2 projects is recommended, but not
required. (See "Bug Fixes and Improvements" below.)<br />

</li>

<li><b><a name="emf110_3">New Mapping Plugins</a></b>


<p>Two new mapping plugins (org.eclipse.emf.mapping and
org.eclipse.emf.mapping.ui) have been added. Documentation for
these new plugins will be forthcoming soon. A sample of their use
is provided by the two xsd2ecore plugins
(org.eclipse.emf.mapping.xsd2ecore and
org.eclipse.emf.mapping.xsd2ecore.editor) in the XSD (XML Schema
Infoset Model) Eclipse Technology Subproject, Version 1.1.0.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below. Where the description
applies to a fix for a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla
number is included after the description.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>XMI files created by the org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi plugin are
now saved with a system-specific line separator. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36913">36913</a>).</li>

<li>You can now use the empty String ("") as the default value for
a String attribute in your Rose model.</li>

<li>EMF now writes the .ecore and .genmodel files using UTF-8 as
the encoding when the default Java locale's language is not
English.</li>

<li>EMF can now read a Rose .mdl file created by a Japanese version
of Rose (Rose 2001A.04.00 Japanese version). (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=36651">36651</a>).</li>

<li>The EMF code generator now supports classes (or more generally
types) whose names end in "Impl". (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=35952">35952</a>).</li>

<li>A number of improvements have been made to the XSD to Ecore
conversion, including improvements in the ability to parse
according to the originating schema.</li>

<li>The implementation for dynamic EMF has been reworked to be
faster and to use less space.</li>

<li>We have introduced org.eclipse.emf.common.util.DelegatingEList,
org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.impl.DelegatingNotifyingListImpl, and
org.eclipse.emf.ecore.util.DelegatingEcoreEList to allow clients to
wrap an existing list implementation that they may have as the
"backing store" for a list that implements all the correct EMF
behaviors.</li>

<li><b>Important!</b> Template changes to improve performance and
to ensure that dynamic EMF works properly for multiple inheritance
will be picked up only if clients regenerate their models, so it is
recommended but not required that clients regenerate.<br />
</li>
</ul>

<b><a name="emf_110e">Build 20030513_0618VL: Bug Fixes and Improvements</a></b> 

<p>There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below. Where the description
applies to a fix for a bug reported through Bugzilla, the Bugzilla
number is included after the description. You can link directly to
the Bugzilla bug using this number.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The method URI.createDeviceURI is deprecated in favor of using
URI.createURI which will always recognize a leading device
component just as URI.createDeviceURI did previously. We ask that
clients remove uses of createDeviceURI so that we can remove the
method from a subsequent drop. In general, any deprecation warning
should be eliminated in anticipation of the support
disappearing.</li>

<li>The feature order of serialized instances is now preserved when
going from XSD to Ecore.</li>

<li>The infinite loop caused by a missing resource for the
org.eclipse.emf.common plugin has been fixed. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37193">37193</a>).</li>

<li>The generated model editor wizard now provides an encoding
choice. <b>Important!</b> Because of this change, a newly generated
editor plugin will now require (and include) the following import
in its plugin.xml file: 

<p>&lt;import plugin="org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi"/&gt;</p>

<p>However, because the plugin.xml file is not regenerated or
merged, clients who are regenerating an editor that they have
generated before will need either to remove the plugin.xml file and
let it be regenerated anew, or to add this import manually to the
existing plugin.xml file. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37366">37366</a>).</p>
</li>

<li>The .properties file used by the generated editor plugin is now
ISO-8859-1 encoded. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37367">37367</a>).</li>

<li>The getPropertyDescriptor(Object object, Object propertyId)
method in the
org.eclipse.emf.edit.provider.ItemProviderAdapter.java now demand
creates properties. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37190">37190</a>).</li>

<li>OPTION_ENCODING is now supported an an alternative/override to
setEncoding() when saving an XMLResource
(org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.XMLResource). An example of its use is
as follows: 

<pre>
    Map options = new HashMap();
    options.put(XMLResource.OPTION_ENCODING, initialObjectCreationPage.getEncoding());
    resource.save(options);
</pre>
</li>

<li>Some minor API changes include removing the empty XMIHelper
interface, eliminating XMLResource.changed in favor of supporting
repeating calls to XMLResource.setID, and changing
EObject.eContainmentFeature's result type from EStructuralFeature
to EReference.</li>

<li>Notification.CREATE in
org.eclipse.emf.common.notify.Notification.java has been
deprecated. We ask that clients remove uses of Notification.CREATE
so that we can remove it from a subsequent drop. In general, any
deprecation warning should be eliminated in anticipation of the
support disappearing.</li>

<b><a name="emf_110f">Build 20030519_0521VL: Bug Fixes and Improvements</a></b> 

<p>There are numerous bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The following now applies to the xsd2ecore mapping: 

<ul>
<li>If an attribute's type is primitive (or it is an enum), it
should be unsettable when mapped to Ecore.</li>

<li>If its type is not primitive (and not an enum) and it has a
default value different from null, it should be unsettable when
mapped to Ecore.</li>

<li>Also, support for promoting a primitive type to a wrapper type
for nillable elements has been added.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The eSettingDelegate() accessor method in the EObjectImpl.java
class has been added to provide access to SettingDelegate.</li>

<li>For the EMF .ecore/.genmodel editors and the generated model
editors, the menubar Edit menu items are now enabled when the
outline and properties views have focus.</li>

<li>Multiline @model annotations are now supported.</li>

<li>A check has been added to ensure that the GenPackage's prefix
is always made to begin with an uppercase letter, if it does not
already.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>
<b><a name="emf_110g">Build 20030527_0913VL: Bug Fixes and Improvements</a></b> 

<p>There are some bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The prepare() method in ReplaceCommand has been corrected to
accept objects of the correct class. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=37953">37953</a>).</li>

<li>Both IntegerCellEditor and FloatCellEditor have been deprecated
in org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui.provider.PropertyDescriptor.java;
EDataTypeCellEditor should be used instead. We ask that clients
remove uses of both IntegerCellEditor and FloatCellEditor so that
we can remove them from a subsequent drop. In general, any
deprecation warning should be eliminated in anticipation of the
support disappearing.</li>

<li>In the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.jet package, two constructors
have been added to the JETEmitter.java class to enable the class
loader to be provided explicitly. Also, the GenModelImpl.java class
in the org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.genmodel.impl package has been
changed to use them.</li>

<li>When using Java annotations, the following will be
ignored:<br />
<br />
 -an interface that appears in the @extends or @implements notation
in the comment (i.e., an interface that is being extended or
implemented)<br />
<br />
The reasoning for this is as follows: If you want to model this,
you would not use @extends (or @implements, as appropriate).
Therefore, the appearance of an interface in the
@extends/@implements implies that it is intentionally outside of
the model.</li>

&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The setSelectionToWidget((List list, boolean reveal) method in
the org.eclipse.emf.mapping.presentation.MappingEditor.java class
has been changed to guard against the list being null. (Bugzilla <a

<p>There are some bug fixes and improvements included with this
build, some of which are described below.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The value of FEEDBACK_INSERT_AFTER has been changed in the
org.eclipse.emf.edit.command.DragAndDropFeedback.java class as a
reault of changes in the SWT constants.</li>

<li>When JETEmitter creates the .JETEmitters project, it now checks
for the existence of the "src" and "runtime" folders before trying
to create them. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38238">38238</a>)</li>

<li>The org.eclipse.emf.codegen.CodeGenPlugin.java class has been

(Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38087">38087</a>)</li>

<li>&lt;package prefix=...&gt; elements have been addded to the
plugin.xml files for all the EMF and XSD plugins. (Bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=38225">38225</a>)</li>

<li>As per the newsgroup discussion, the following two constructors
have been added in the
org.eclipse.emf.common.ui.celleditor.ExtendedComboBoxEditor.java
class: 

<ul>
<li>public ExtendedComboBoxCellEditor(Composite composite, List
list, ILabelIProvider labelProvider, int style)</li>

<li>public ExtendedComboBoxCellEditor(Composite composite, List
