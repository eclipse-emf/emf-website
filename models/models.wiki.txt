==Models==

===[http://www.eclipticalsoftware.com/emf/atom/ Atom Syndication Format in EMF]=== 
By [http://www.eclipticalsoftware.com Peter Nehrer], 2006-06-09<br />This project aims to provide an EMF-based model for 
representing the Atom Syndication Format. Its deliverables include an extensible Ecore model along with a set of 
generated implementation classes (both model and editing support). The Ecore model closely follows the official Atom 
Syndication Format Specification. Content rules that cannot be represented in the model itself are encapsulated in a set 
of external validators. This gives the model the ability to represent incomplete Atom documents or those that are not 
100% standard compliant.

===[http://www.elver.org EMF Persistency Layer using Hibernate/JPOX with support for EJB3-EAnnotations]=== 
By [http://www.elver.org Martin Taal], 2006-06-08<br />Elver EMF Store is a persistency solution for EMF using 
Hibernate or JPOX/JDO 2.0. It supports automatic creation of EMF to Relational Mappings and the related database
schemas. The solution also contains a runtime layer to support specific EMF features. EMF Objects can be stored and 
retrieved using advanced queries (HQL or JDOQL). EMF resource implementations are provided for integration with EMF 
Editors. The persistence logic and mapping can be controlled using EJB3-like annotations. Most of the EJB3 mapping 
standard is supported.

 [[Image:eclipse.png]][[Image:eclipse.png]][[Image:eclipse.png]][[Image:eclipse.png]] '''Sympedia GenFw Generator Framework Review''', 
 by [http://www.kutter.org Philipp W. Kutter], 2006-05-25
 We have been using GenFw productively in a large project in the financial industry over the last 3 months. 
 Originally we have chosen GenFw because it allowed to do certain things (like project specific code 
 formatting/adding removing templates) which where not working in EMF back then. The usage of GenFw was 
 straight forward, and it helped us nicely manage our custom JET templates. The option to do EMF without 
 merging is something very interesting in very large projects, like the one we worked on. The developer 
 of GenFw, Eike Stepper did a tremendous job porting his framework back from Eclipse 3.2/EMF 2.2 to 
 Eclipse 3.1/EMF 2.1. Without this special effort, our EMF introduction would have been canceled by 
 the management. In the meantime the two main issues with EMF (formatting, adding/removing templates) 
 are solved, and our client was ready to move on to 3.2. Currently we investigate the usage of GenFw 
 for pure code generation with Jet Templates, which are triggered by OCL rules. Last but not least, 
 I would like to mention that the tutorials where great to get our people started with the framework.



==Frameworks==

===[http://metadiff.sourceforge.net/ MetaDiff]=== 
By [http://metadiff.sourceforge.net/ Mark Kofman], 2005-08-02<br />MetaDiff is a generic model comparison solution. 
Generic, in a sense, that it should make possible to compare models based on different meta-models specified by EMF. 
It is important to point out that result is not a tool but a framework. In addition to model comparison functionality, 
framework should also give a possibility to extend available comparison algorithms, and provide practical way of working 
with different meta-models.

===[https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=88344&package_id=152833 Open ArchitectureWare for EMF]=== 
By [http://www.openarchitectureware.org Sven Efftinge], 2005-05-25<br />The open ArchitectureWare framework for EMF 
consists of the following parts:

'''Workflow engine:''' You could think of it as an Ant for MDSD processes. 
[[http://architecturware.sourceforge.net/doc.html more]]

'''Xpand ported to EMF:''' Xpand is a template 
language created for code generators, only. Therefore it's very simple and effective. It provides:
* expressions on core model level (not Java level)
* operations for ELists (filter, union, intersection, complement)
* invocation of features on ELists (e.g "package.classifiers.name" will return a list of ecore:EString instances) - simple constructs (FOREACH, IF, LET)
* a FILE construct (define which files to generate inside the templates)
* Call to Helpers (static Java-Methods)

'''Xpandeditor ported to EMF:''' 
* syntax highlighting 
* code completion 
* syntax validation 
* outline view

An example and basic documentation is included.

===[http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/emfatic Emfatic]=== 
By [http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/emfatic Chris Daly], 2004-11-10<br />Emfatic is a language for representing EMF Ecore models in a simple textual form. <br /><br /> There are currently several different ways to construct and modify EMF Ecore models, including annotated Java, XML Schema, Unified Modeling Language (UML) tools, and the EMF model editor. The advantage of Emfatic is that it represents an entire Ecore model in a single source file and it uses a Java-like syntax familiar to many programmers. <br /><br /> Emfatic comprises several Eclipse plug-ins, which include an editor and a parser for the language. The Eclipse plug-ins add actions that allow Emfatic source code to be compiled into an Ecore model and also allow Ecore models to be decompiled into Emfatic source code.

Notification Gatherer component is a simple utility component that automates listening to events that happen in EMF object graph. Such 
code usually is not very complex, but it is quite error prone because a lot of small things should be done in a lot of places. So, from 
our experience, the component enhances clarity of the code and reduces number of bugs. The component is a reimplementation of the idea 
that was previously implemented in NSMDF and NSUML open source projects. These projects have an idea that is similar to EMF one, but 
their APIs significantly differ from EMF API. The plug-in is submitted as patch to EMF team. URL points to corresponding RFE.
